The backend is not implemented.  The frontend, named /storyforge, contains an expo based app with API services.  

Storyforge uses Huggingface to generate choose-your-own adventure stories with illustrations for children. This was developed as
a way to explore the expo framework capabilities (and entertain my daughter) but has not been deployed to production status anywhere.
